I need some help analyzing data provided by the VA. Each of the 851 treatment facilities publish each day an excel
spreadsheet detailing the time new patients and established patients have to wait for treatment. These data is
reported for each of the 5 to 30 medical specialties each facility provides. Not every facility provides all the 30
possible treatment areas.

We have been collecting these spreadsheets since February 18, 2025. The downloaded spreadsheets are then uploaded into
a Postgres database table, with a row for each reporting facility and each treatment specialty. We have so far
collected nearly 1,000,000 observations.

our end goal is to build a system that alerts us when patient wait times (new or established) increase  to  a
statistically significant degree. We want to know if:

1) treatment times increase significantly for a specific treatment type at a specific facility,
2) treatment times increase significantly at a specific facility,
3) treatment times increase significantly for a specific treatment type across all facilities within a state,
4) treatment times increase significantly within a state
5) if a facility stops reporting data
6) if a facility starts to report the same data over and over,
7) anything else that might indicate a degradation of service that would affect Veterans served by the US.

In addition to needing help analyzing the data we have already collected, we want to know what meta data we should
collect or synthesize nightly that would help us identify negative trends in real time.
